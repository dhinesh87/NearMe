It seems there might be some confusion here. Jim Corbett National Park is actually located in the state of Uttarakhand,
not in Krishnagiri. Krishnagiri, a district in Tamil Nadu, doesn't have a park named after Jim Corbett. However, it's
possible that there might be a park or wildlife sanctuary in Krishnagiri, but it would have a different name. If you're 
interested, I can provide information about any parks or wildlife sanctuaries in Krishnagiri, just let me know!
